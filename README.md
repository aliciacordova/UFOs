# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

We help our friend Dana to create a more in depth analysis of UFO sightings in her dynamic table, by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. So we add add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:

### DELIVARABLE #1 Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria 

##  Link to UFO Sightings webpage

The deployed webpage is accessible at https://aliciacordova.github.io/UFOs/ 

This is the initial page. At the top you'll see the navigation bar "UFO Sightings".

The user enters the desired date, city, state, country and shape. The change is detected and the table is updated accordingly.

 ## Summary:
- 1. The summary addresses one drawback of this webpage.

One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.

- 2. The summary addresses two additional recommendations for further development. 

A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields. Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter. 
Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
